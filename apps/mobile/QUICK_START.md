// Get elections
const elections = await fetchElections();

// Get representatives for an address
const reps = await fetchRepresentatives('1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20500');

// Get only federal representatives
const federalReps = await fetchRepresentatives(
  address,
  ['country'], // only federal level
  ['legislatorUpperBody', 'legislatorLowerBody'] // senators and representatives
);
```

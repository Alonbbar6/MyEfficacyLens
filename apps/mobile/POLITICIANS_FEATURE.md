# Politicians Screen - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. API Integration
- **Updated** `services/api/politicians.ts` to use the working `civicApi` service with `fetch` instead of `axios`
- **Added** proper error handling and detailed logging
- **Implemented** address formatting helper function
- **Fixed** API calls to properly fetch representatives from Google Civic Information API

### 2. Component Architecture
- **Created** `components/politician/PoliticianCard.tsx` - Reusable politician card component
  - Photo display with fallback to initials avatar
  - Party affiliation badge with color coding
  - Contact information display
  - Error handling for failed image loads
  - Dark mode support

### 3. Politicians Screen Features
- **Search functionality** - Filter politicians by name or position (client-side, memoized for performance)
- **Level filters** - All, Federal, State, Local
- **Loading states** - Activity indicator while fetching
- **Error handling** - Detailed error messages with retry button
- **Pull-to-refresh** - Swipe down to reload politicians list
- **Empty states** - Helpful messages when no politicians found
- **Default location** - Falls back to Washington DC (20500) if no user location set

### 4. Data Flow
```
User Location (or DC default)
    ↓

    ↓
politiciansApi.getRepresentativesByAddress()
    ↓
civicApi.fetchRepresentatives()
    ↓
Google Civic Information API
    ↓
Map to Politician type
    ↓
Display in PoliticianCard components
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Mapping:
```typescript
Google Civic API → Politician Type
- officials[].name → name
- office.name → position
- official.party → party (mapped to Democrat/Republican/Independent/Other)
- office.levels[0] → level (mapped to Federal/State/Local)
- official.photoUrl → photo
- official.phones[0] → phone
- official.emails[0] → email
- office.divisionId → district
```

### Level Mapping:
- `country` → Federal
- `administrativeArea1` → State
- `locality` or `administrativeArea2` → Local

### Party Mapping:
- Contains "democrat" → Democrat (Blue badge)
- Contains "republican" → Republican (Red badge)
- Contains "independent" → Independent (Purple badge)
- Other → Other (Gray badge)

## 🧪 Testing

### To Test:
1. Open the app (already running on http://localhost:8081)
2. Navigate to the "Politicians" tab
3. You should see:
   - Loading indicator initially
   - List of politicians for Washington DC (default)
   - Search bar and filter buttons working
   - Politician cards with all information

### Expected Behavior:
- **On Load**: Fetches politicians for user's location (or DC if not set)
- **Search**: Filters list as you type
- **Filters**: Shows only selected level (Federal/State/Local)
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Reloads the list
- **Error**: Shows error message with retry button
- **Empty**: Shows "No politicians found" if list is empty

## 🐛 Debugging

### If politicians don't load:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify API key in `.env` and `app.json`
3. Check network tab for API request/response
4. Look for console.log messages:
   - "Fetching representatives for address: [address]"
   - "Found X offices and Y officials"
   - "Mapped Z politicians"

### Common Issues:
- **404 Error**: API endpoint issue (should be fixed now)
- **Empty list**: No politicians found for location
- **Image not loading**: Falls back to initials avatar automatically

## 📱 User Experience

### Smooth Interactions:
- ✅ Memoized filtering for performance
- ✅ Optimized re-renders
- ✅ Fast search with no lag
- ✅ Graceful error handling
- ✅ Loading states for all async operations

### Visual Feedback:
- ✅ Active filter button highlighted
- ✅ Party color badges
- ✅ Clear typography hierarchy
- ✅ Consistent spacing and padding
- ✅ Dark mode support

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test the politicians list in the app
2. Verify search and filters work correctly
3. Check that politician cards display properly

### Future Enhancements:
- [ ] Politician detail page (tap on card)

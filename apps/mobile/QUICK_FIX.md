# Quick Fix Applied ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Boolean Type Conversion in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
- Wrapped `darkMode` with `Boolean()` to ensure it's always a boolean
- This prevents string values from AsyncStorage causing type errors

### 2. Added Scheme to `app.json`
- Added `"scheme": "politicaltracker"` to fix the linking warning
- This is required for deep linking in production builds

### 3. Fixed AsyncStorage Boolean Handling in `stores/userStore.ts`
- Added explicit `Boolean()` conversion when loading `darkMode` from storage
- Added explicit `Boolean()` conversion for `isOnboarded`
- This ensures values are always booleans, not strings

## How to Test

### Step 1: Clear App Data
Since AsyncStorage might have corrupted string values, clear it:

**In your terminal:**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)

# Clear AsyncStorage by deleting the app from simulator
# Then restart:
npx expo start -c
```

### Step 2: Reset Simulator (iOS)
In the iOS Simulator menu:
- **Device → Erase All Content and Settings**

OR just delete the app:
- Long press the app icon → Delete App

### Step 3: Restart Fresh
```bash
npx expo start -c
# Press 'i' to open iOS simulator
```

## What Was Wrong

The error "expected dynamic type 'boolean', but had type 'string'" was caused by:

1. **AsyncStorage stores everything as strings**
2. When loading `darkMode` from storage, it was coming back as `"true"` or `"false"` (strings)
3. React Native's Tabs component expected a real boolean for conditional rendering
4. The ternary operators (`darkMode ? ... : ...`) were evaluating string `"false"` as truthy

## The Fix

Now we:
- ✅ Explicitly convert to boolean when loading from storage
- ✅ Explicitly convert to boolean when using in components  
- ✅ Added scheme to prevent linking warnings
- ✅ Ensured all boolean values are actual booleans, not strings

## Expected Result

After clearing app data and restarting:
- ✅ No type errors
- ✅ Tabs render correctly
- ✅ No scheme warning
- ✅ Dark mode toggle works (when implemented in UI)

**If you still get errors after clearing data, the issue might be in the Metro bundler cache. Run:**

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
rm -rf .expo
npx expo start -c
```

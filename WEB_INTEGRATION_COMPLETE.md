## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Web App

```bash
cd /Users/alonsobardales/Desktop/Political\ app/efficacy-monorepo
pnpm dev:web
```

The app will run on http://localhost:3003 (or next available port)

### 2. Navigate to Dashboard

1. Go to http://localhost:3003
2. Click "Sign In" or go to http://localhost:3003/dashboard
3. You'll see the new Efficacy Dashboard with three cards

### 3. Test Politicians Feature

1. Click on the "Politicians" card
2. You'll see the politicians page with a location input
3. Try these test locations:
   - **"20500"** (Washington DC - shows President, VP, etc.)
   - **"33101"** (Miami, FL - shows Florida representatives)
   - **"Alabama"** (shows Alabama state legislators)
   - **"New York, NY"** (shows New York representatives)

### 4. Expected Results

**For "20500" (Washington DC):**
- President of the United States
- Vice President
- DC Representatives
- US Senators

**For "Alabama":**
- US Senators from Alabama
- Alabama State Legislators (from OpenStates API)

## 📦 API Integration
